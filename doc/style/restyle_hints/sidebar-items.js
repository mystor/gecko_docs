Similarly, when various attributes of an element change, we may also need to restyle things with id, class, and attribute selectors. Doing this conservatively is expensive, and so we use RestyleHints to short-circuit work we know is unnecessary."]],"trait":[["ElementSnapshot","In order to compute restyle hints, we perform a selector match against a list of partial selectors whose rightmost simple selector may be sensitive to the thing being changed. We do this matching twice, once for the element as it exists now and once for the element as it existed at the time of the last restyle. If the results of the selector match differ, that means that the given partial selector is sensitive to the change, and we compute a restyle hint based on its combinator."]]});
